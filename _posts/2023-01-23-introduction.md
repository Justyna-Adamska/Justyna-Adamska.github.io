Hello :) I decided to write this blog to show you know my path as self-taught developer. One day I had this idea about changing my career and stepping into IT. I believe that I am not the only one. Of course that was a couple of months ago and I have some reflections on which tools worked for me and which didn't. If you are thinking about starting a job as a developer, I am sure that my experience can save you a lot of time and stress. In the upcoming posts I am going to comment on different tools available for free that are offering knowledge as well as practice in programming.
