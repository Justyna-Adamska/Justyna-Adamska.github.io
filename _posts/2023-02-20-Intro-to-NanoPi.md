Hello. Today I will start a series of posts about my adventure with NanoPi. What is NanoPi? In essence it is a single board computer (SBC). Perhaps you’ve heard about RaspberryPi. NanoPi is just like it, only smaller, cheaper and well, better accessible (at least in Poland) in the times of chips shortage. NanoPi is less popular and less described than RaspberryPi so I thought I could play a little bit with it and let you know my opinion. 

This super small device gives you the chance to design your own mini computer. It is a great way to learn about ARM processor on the real life example.

Where can you find ARM processors? Basically everywhere – in mobile phones, various detectors and homemade devices.

I am going to apply hands-on practice in order to get to know various aspects that programmer has to deal with in the real life.

The truth is that my weather station at home broke down and I thought, “since I already have NanoPi, why not?” And there we have it, I am building my own weather station. The idea is to present information from sensors connected to NanoPi on the website. I will handle databases and apply a little bit of frontend to make the website pretty.
